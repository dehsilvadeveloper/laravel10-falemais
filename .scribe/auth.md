# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can generate your <b>API access token</b> by using the endpoint `auth/login`, present in the group <b>authentication</b> of this documentation.
